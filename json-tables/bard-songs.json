"38":	"‘You Can Just Call Me The Gnome’ – A fast-paced, silly song telling the increasing exploits of Hamish McTamish, a fictional gnome adventurer. Each time the chorus is sung, Hamish’s name is lengthened with more titles (the last chorus includes as many silly titles as the singer can think of and can sing in a single breath) followed by ‘but you can just call me the Gnome!’ Although believed to be human in origin, gnomes love the song, and an informal competition has sprung up as to the longest final chorus.

That adventurous bard made it back to the surface, but not understanding the dialect of the deep, transposed the lullaby into a few other chords and added an improvisational lick of their own. That was a thousand years ago, and people have been humming and playing the tune up here ever since then, 50 generations later.",
